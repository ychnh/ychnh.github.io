<h2>HUNGERFORD THM.1.4.7</h2>

<p>\(|HK| = \dfrac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|}\)</p>

<ul>
<li>ISSUE: Stuck working on cosets order of HK</li>
<li>Got  stuck because I was trying to piece together bits of what I 'guessed' was the solution.
And was hoping would eventually just give me the solution through guessing.</li>
<li>I needed a clear sense of direction that I understand</li>
<li>Also needed to invest more time understanding/organizing the properties of the elements in the problem which came up while I was working on the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Break</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prevent burnout</li>
<li>Something you find rewarding
<ul>
<li>Social activity?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Something which you enjoy</li>
<li>Something which gives you closure
<ul>
<li>Walk, food, lifting, movie</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be mindful how you fill up the pages and what you write. Too much and it will clutter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<ul>
<li>If what you are trying to prove is true, there IS a natural solution/connection/reason to get there!</li>
<li>Like programming was difficult when I was young, I am beginning to understand and get better at mathematics.
It is certainly something that you can get better at!
Keep doing what you are doing. Work through the book. Organize. Review. Improve yourself.
Blind think. See what you can extend.</li>
<li>Thinking is a muscle. It is something that you can improve.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do I understand all the members/elements/components of the problem?</li>
<li>What should I do if I am not interested in a topic?
<ul>
<li>Find something that is interesting about it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What am I looking for? Did i understand the problem?</li>
<li>What properties does it have?</li>
<li>What is it made of?</li>
<li>What does it belong to?</li>
<li>Do existing things play/act with it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>HUNGERFORD THM 1.4.8</h2>

<p>\(|H:H \cap K| \leq |G:K|\). If \(|G:K|\) is finite \(|H:H \cap K| = |G:K| \leftrightarrow HK = G\)</p>

<ul>
<li>I began the problem by trying to understand what the statement was asking me to prove and the significance.
<ul>
<li>That \(K\) has more cosets in \(G\) than \(|K \cap H|\) has in \(H\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First, I started the problem by looking at the relationship between the set and subset and number of cosets.</li>
<li>But it became clear that this would not lead to any significant result or show interesting relationship.</li>
<li><p>Then I looked for a mapping between the LHS to the RHS that was a function and injective.</p>

<ul>
<li>This gave me the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I have overlooked on how to show inequalities or counting, which is by showing a function from A to B.</p></li>
<li><p>I should review the different approaches and select the probable one before diving in</p></li>
<li><p>When I was trying to show the equality part, I approached it first by drawing out all the equalities and trying to match
together a solution by guessing.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was getting stuck due to a similar reason as 1.4.7 and I looked for a clear direction.</li>
<li>I realized that all i needed was to show that the mapping i showed was surjective under the the condition \(|HK| = |G|\)</li>
<li>I was looking at \(|G:K|\) and the cosets \(Kg = Khk\) and wishfully thought what if \(Kkh\)?</li>
<li>Turns out it HK = KH!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I am really proud that I learned from my previous mistake. and was able to look for a different approach and not keep guess</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Burn out</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I have stopped making progress on the problem. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>I felt stuck.</li>
<li>It was not going as easy as b4.</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why did you feel stuck?</p>

<ul>
<li>progress wrt chapters completed
<ul>
<li>assumed all chapters are equal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There were many ideas that are new and unexplored. Many questsions.</li>
<li>I felt like I was rushing through it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusions </p>

<ul>
<li>Work on another study subject</li>
<li>A new chapter with many new ideas will take time to explore
<ul>
<li>chapters are not equal</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How can I over come?</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your time, and be consistant
<ul>
<li>When you rush, you take the magic out of it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Push through. Inner strength.</li>
<li>Recharge, Rest really well.</li>
<li>Think of the bigger goal</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>GO HARD</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Hungerford Problem 1.5.19</h2>

<p>Suppose \(H\leq G, N\trianglelefteq G\), then \(([G:H],|N|)=1 \rightarrow N<H\) and \(([G:N],|H|)=1) \rightarrow H<N \)
* I spent alot of time on this problem, and also learned a number of things.
* How can I improve?
  * I think I need to improve in seeing connections and pathways I can go down
  * Also understanding the problem and related questions at hand</p>

<h2>Prove that every permutation is a product of distjoin cycles</h2>

<ul>
<li>given a cycle, orbit creates a equi relation btw the elements of {1...N}
<ul>
<li>given a permutation, can you have an orbit? Yes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The elements of the orbin form a cycle</li>
<li><p>The cycle is unique up to permutation
  a0,a1,a2,a3
  b0,b1,b2,b3
  Suppose they are not same according to permutation 
  this means there is one disjoint cycle in a that is diff froma disjoint cycle in b</p></li>
<li><p>When I first went through, I did not really think of the concepts such as orbit.</p></li>
<li>How does this kind of idea arise? How does this kind of naming arise?</li>
</ul>
