## Break

## Stuck working on cosets order of HK
* 

## Notes
* Be mindful how you fill up the pages and what you write. Too much and it will clutter.

## Motivation
* Like programming was difficult when I was young, I am beginning to understand and get better at mathematics.
It is certainly something that you can get better at!
Keep doing what you are doing. Work through the book. Organize. Review. Improve yourself.
Blind think. See what you can extend.
* Thinking is a muscle. It is something that you can improve.

## Questions
* What should I do if I am not interested in a topic?
	* Find something that is interesting about it.
* What am I looking for? Did i understand the problem?
* What properties does it have?
* What is it made of?
* What does it belong to?
* Do existing things play/act with it?
