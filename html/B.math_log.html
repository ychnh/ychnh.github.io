<h2>Working again</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dont fill your mind with social media</li>
<li>Value your time and attention</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hungerford Problem 1.5.19</h2>

<p>Suppose \(H\leq G, N\trianglelefteq G\), then \(([G:H],|N|)=1 \rightarrow N<H\) and \(([G:N],|H|)=1) \rightarrow H<N \)</p>

<ul>
<li>I spent alot of time on this problem, and also learned a number of things.</li>
<li>How can I improve?
<ul>
<li>I think I need to improve in seeing connections and pathways I can go down</li>
<li>Also understanding the problem and related questions at hand</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Prove that every permutation is a product of distjoin cycles</h2>

<ul>
<li>given a cycle, orbit creates a equi relation btw the elements of {1...N}
<ul>
<li>given a permutation, can you have an orbit? Yes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The elements of the orbin form a cycle</li>
<li>The cycle is unique up to permutation
<ul>
<li>a0,a1,a2,a3</li>
<li>b0,b1,b2,b3</li>
<li>Suppose they are not same according to permutation </li>
<li>this means there is one disjoint cycle in a that is diff froma disjoint cycle in b</li>
<li>then any element in the orbit of this cycle should belong in one of the disjoint cycles since it is an element that is changed (non-ident)</li>
<li>DISJOINT cycles which share same element are the same if they define the same function</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cor order of ab is lcm of the order of a and b</h2>

<h2>Cor order of product of cycles is lcm of the orders of the cycles</h2>

<ul>
<li>Need to extend this to work on disjoint cycles
  * order is the least number where a^m=1. Which means it divides every other number.</li>
<li><p>restrict the product of disjoint cycles on their orbit</p>

<h2>Any Sn can be decomposed into transpositions</h2></li>
<li><p>\((1234) = (12)(13)(14)\)</p></li>
<li><p>When I first went through, I did not really think of the concepts such as orbit.</p></li>
<li><p>How does this kind of idea arise? How does this kind of naming arise?</p></li>
<li><p>can you show that this is unique? No it is not.</p></li>
<li>Is the number of transpositions unique? (No you can easily add identity) is even odd transposition well defined?</li>
</ul>

<h1>20200615 (Tue)</h1>

<ul>
<li>Show that every permutation can be classified as odd xor even</li>
<li>Now a transposition swaps two elments</li>
<li><p>Is it possible to have a odd number of swaps from identity be equal to even number of swaps?</p></li>
<li><p>IDEA (A) Is it possible to extend by induction?</p>

<ul>
<li>S2 is very simple</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>IDEA (B) How can we use commutativity? transpositions are mostly disjoint, and dijoint cycles commute</p>

<ul>
<li>(ab)(ac) = a-b, b-c, c-a abc</li>
<li>\((abc)(ax) = (abcx)\)</li>
<li>\((bca)(bx) = (bcax)\)</li>
<li>Ok so every permutation is a unique product of disjoint cycles (up to reordering)</li>
<li>Then if we can prove that a cycle-s even odd even is unique then we can show odd/even is unique.</li>
<li>Every cycle can be broken into transpositions</li>
<li>And it can be either one of these two cases</li>
<li>\((abc)(ax)\)</li>
<li>\((abc)(ab)\) (cb)</li>
<li>\((abc)(ac)\) (ab)</li>
<li>\((abcd)(ac)\) (ab)(dc)</li>
<li>(ab)(dc)(ac) = (ab)(cd)(ca) = (ab)(cda) = (ab)(acd) = (abcd)</li>
<li>A transposition applied to a cycle can either increase it by one or split it</li>
<li>if it is split, precisely one transposition is required to recover it?</li>
<li>After some thinking we realize approach B is not bery fruitful because one can have many different representsations and adding of transpositiosn</li>
<li>might end up with structures were we dont necessarily have cycles even.</li>
<li>STUCK</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IDEA So we move back to considering case (A) and look at for case S2 and our hypothesis is clearly true
<ul>
<li>Let us also use (B) and restrict our view on cycles of size 2 (because any permutation in S2 is a cycle) and it makes our analysis down the line simpler</li>
<li>Now we consider the SN case. And look at what needs to happen right before the final transposition is applied. We must have a map where only 2 elements are out of place.</li>
<li>Final Cycle = X(ab) what is the shape of X? If it is a cycle or a product of 2 smaller cycles we are in luck since we can definitely determine the odd/even of those</li>
<li>Is there a way we can change our view so that the final is a ident? (NO but we can view FINAL as a cycle)</li>
<li>So now we need information on how to deduce the shape of X, the thing right before a cycle which when multipllied by a transpose will give our cycle
  * How do we get it?
  * Take a cycle and change 2 elements
  * (V) Great so if you can write a formal way to state this the proof will fall out then
  * Since X is decomposed into smaller cycles who,s total sum is N-1
    * So X will break up into cycles whose combined lengths is N-1
      * N even number -> N-1 odd: (Odd+Even=Odd) or (Odd) -> X is composed of odd -> X+1= N is composed of Even
      * N odd number -> N-1 even: (Even+Even = Odd+Odd=Even) or (Even) -> X is composed of Even -> X+1 = N is composed of Odd
    * Which implies X is </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Formalization of (V)
<ul>
<li>Since we have a cycle, we can take one of the elements being swapped as the first.</li>
<li>Let 2a be the two elements being swapped per our notation</li>
<li>The placement of the 2nd element will create 2 disjoint cycle ( 1abc... )  and the remainder ( 234...(a-1) )</li>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>123456</li>
<li>234561</li>
<li>123456</li>
<li>324561</li>
<li>123456</li>
<li>534261</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Great a cycle can be </li>
</ul>

<h2>How can you</h2>

<ul>
<li>Train your ability to seek out different avenues and attack the problem from these angles?</li>
<li><p>Perhaps ability to quickly rule out some of the options?</p>

<h2>After working independently and deriving the next two steps of the book, I've come to realizations</h2></li>
<li><p>Thinking on your own and asking questions</p>

<ul>
<li>This is definitely the way to study. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Peristence and Tenacity) Some theorems and ideas are difficult and may take time and effort. Dont get frustrated</li>
<li>You have to put in work. Be serious about it. Make a genuine effort and think hard.</li>
<li>(Branch) out different paths of attack and explore the problem. 
<ul>
<li>(Prune/Evaluate) Check and find counter examples or counter proofs to prune your branches.</li>
<li>(Isolate) Do explore different subset of ideas and isolated events. And consolidate and organize your findings in this area</li>
<li>(Reuse) what you find in a different branch. What you study in one area is useful and meaningful to the whole picture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Question everything</li>
</ul>

<h2>Even permutations is a normal subgroup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Subgroup is clear \(a\)</li>
<li>Ok so it does not commute but clearly the \(oeo^{-1} \in EVEN\)</li>
<li><p>Great it is normal. What is structure of \(\dfrac{G}{EVEN}\)? or Size of [G:EVEN]
  * Consider the mapping from even to odd by removing the last element from each even element, wait this is not well defined.</p>

<ul>
<li>consider mapping from EVEN-> ODD by mult by single transpose (12)
  * Well defined since mult is well def
  * Surjective because for any odd o, f(o(12)) = o
  * Injective b/c f(o)=f(j) = o(12)=j(12) -> o=j</li>
<li>So cardinality of two sets are equal =&gt; [G:EVEN]=2
<h2>Subgroup is simple if it has no other trivial subgroup</h2></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Odd is not subgroup because it does not contain identity</p>

<h2>No other subgroup has index 2</h2></li>
<li><p>I thought about how to draw contradiction</p></li>
<li>The most direct line of thought that helped me was this 
<ul>
<li>Take any subgroup that has index 2.</li>
<li>For all we know, this subgroup could be the alternating subgroup. 
<ul>
<li>So what makes it different from An?</li>
<li>What must this object be or not be?</li>
<li><strong>(Pruning)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I work/play with the current assumptions, what possible conclusions can I arrive at?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If it is an absurd conclusion, we must change/modify the assumptions.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It must contain an odd element and even elements
oe=j</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Even permutation is the unique subgroup of index 2 in Sn</h2>

<ul>
<li>I tried many many different approaches 
<ul>
<li>I even explored the consequences of the assumption of another index existing
  * the cosets of index 2 are contained by inverses
  * S, the other subgroup must contain odd numbers
  * The even subset of S is N/4
      * This is instrumental because it shows that it is only posible for Sn that are divisible by 4
  * S is normal</li>
<li>I feel like where I looked today, there isn't really an answer because I am showing things which are already true</li>
<li>i.e using normality to show normality</li>
<li>I must find some special connection that uses the even/odd structure of Sn</li>
<li>Have faith, if it is true, then the solution and the nature of the explanation exists.
<ul>
<li>It is much difficult if you do not know if it is true or not. This is where your intuition? No you guess XD</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Really difficult and stuck on (prev problem)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ok it was a excepttional difficult exercise that requires a hint of use of a lemma</li>
<li>I think my advice is to look at a specific example and draw some inspiration</li>
</ul>

<h2>The time is now</h2>

<ul>
<li>I dont want to be fake. I want to be fing legit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Sn</h2>

<ul>
<li>How does S2 extend to S3? or SN to SN+1
<ul>
<li>Well... cycles of 2 and 3</li>
<li>How does one extra value change the existing structure permutation combination wise
  * Consider the set of cosets \([ SN(x,N+1) | x\in 1..N+1 ]\)
  * Show that each coset is disjoint
      * suppose f(x,N+1) = g(y,N+1)
          * f = g(y,N+1)(x,N+1) = g (yxN+1) Can we get f by itself? Yes!
          * This means that for g(a)=x where a is a member of 1..N f(x)=N+1 which means f is not in SN
            * Or just that fact that N+1 maps to y is a more direct contradiction
  * So one can form a mapping from the elements int he union of these cosets into SN+1 and it must be bijection since their sizes are the same
      * (RECALL) One intresting proof about same cardinality being a bijection
  * In conclusion the additional set of transpositions introduced by N+1 is precisely enough</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another question: How many isomorphic subgroups of SN is there in SN+1? You can have SN while keeping the ith element fixed (and just rename the numbering)
  * But there is definitely overlap. Just look at identity, it is shared by all isomoprhic subgroups of SN</li>
<li>So S4 is just [S3(x4) | x in 1..4]

So if you had a 3 cycle and transposition which contains 2 of the cycle elements, then you'll get all the other transpositions</li>
<li>Is this true for all cases? Yes The posible transpositions involving 3 elements (ab) (bc) (ac)

One odd subset cannot contain them all in a subgroup because this would generate the entire subgroup
Can a subgroup contain all the transpositions?
In S3 product of 2 3-cycles is another cycle how does this extend to S4?</p>

<ul>

  * (rsa) = (rs)(ra)
  * (rsb) = (rs)(rb)
  * (ra)(rs)(rs)(rb) = (ra)(rb) = (rab)

  * (rab) = (bra) = (br)(ba)
  * (rcb) = (brc) = (br)(bc)
  * (ba)(br)(br)(bc) = (ba)(bc) = (bac) = (acb)</p></li>

<h2>HUNGERFORD THM 1.4.8</h2>

<p>\(|H:H \cap K| \leq |G:K|\). If \(|G:K|\) is finite \(|H:H \cap K| = |G:K| \leftrightarrow HK = G\)</p>

<ul>
<li>I began the problem by trying to understand what the statement was asking me to prove and the significance.
<ul>
<li>That \(K\) has more cosets in \(G\) than \(|K \cap H|\) has in \(H\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First, I started the problem by looking at the relationship between the set and subset and number of cosets.</li>
<li>But it became clear that this would not lead to any significant result or show interesting relationship.</li>
<li><p>Then I looked for a mapping between the LHS to the RHS that was a function and injective.</p>

<ul>
<li>This gave me the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I have overlooked on how to show inequalities or counting, which is by showing a function from A to B.</p></li>
<li><p>I should review the different approaches and select the probable one before diving in</p></li>
<li><p>When I was trying to show the equality part, I approached it first by drawing out all the equalities and trying to match
together a solution by guessing.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was getting stuck due to a similar reason as 1.4.7 and I looked for a clear direction.</li>
<li>I realized that all i needed was to show that the mapping i showed was surjective under the the condition \(|HK| = |G|\)</li>
<li>I was looking at \(|G:K|\) and the cosets \(Kg = Khk\) and wishfully thought what if \(Kkh\)?</li>
<li>Turns out it HK = KH!</li>

<li><p>I am really proud that I learned from my previous mistake. and was able to look for a different approach and not keep guess</p></li>
