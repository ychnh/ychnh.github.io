## Growth vs fixed mindset

* two meanings to ability, not one: a fixed ability that needs to be proven, and a changeable ability that can be developed through learning. 
* That's how the mindsets were born. I knew instantly which one I had. I realized why I'd always been so concerned about mistakes and failures. And I recognized for the first time that I had a choice. When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other—the world of changing qualities—it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself
* IS SUCCESS ABOUT LEARNING—OR PROVING YOU’RE SMART?
* Kids who are born smart don't do mistakes,” they told us.

* Examples
* Academia

     One day, you go to a class that is really important to you and that you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class. You got a C+. You’re very disappointed. That evening on the way back to your home, you find that you’ve gotten a parking ticket. Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your experience but are sort of brushed of
     So how would they cope? “I wouldn’t bother to put so much time and effort into doing well in anything.” (In other words, don’t let anyone measure you again.) “Do nothing.” “Stay in bed.” “Get drunk.” “Eat.” “Yell at someone if I get a chance to.” “Eat chocolate.” “Listen to music and pout.” “Go into my closet and sit there.” “Pick a fight with somebody.” “Cry.” “Break something.” “What is there to do
     What is there to do! You know, when I wrote the vignette, I intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F. It was a midterm rather than a final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were “sort of brushed off,” not rejected outright

* Job Career

     When I was a young woman, I wanted a prince-like mate. Very handsome, very successful. A big cheese. I wanted a glamorous career, but nothing too hard or risky. And I wanted it all to come to me as validation of who I was.   It would be many years before I was satisfied. I got a great guy, but he was a work in progress. I have a great career, but boy, is it a constant challenge. Nothing was easy. So why am I satisfied? I changed my mindse

## Journaling vs Documents
* Journaling should be a free flowing essence of ideas
  * which require reflection and going-back-to to find ideas and thoughts you have
* The documents are a carefully distilled version of the ideas which you have put into practice


## Frustration, stuck, burnt out
* ?Why does this frustration occur?
  * Barrier against learning it on my own, discovering it on my own
* ?Why is this important?
  * It is a proper way to learn
  * I have alot of pride and I think doing it this way is right
* ?What is the end result?
  * Burnout. It's terrible.
  * Demotivation
  * I feel frustrated so I don't want to be frustrated
    * So I end up devaluing my pride ( which is definitely not what I want )
* ?What should be done?
  * Keep trying, dont give up
  * try a little bit easier version
    * Identify what is hard and try an easier version
    * Take some hints
    * Look at it briefly and try to reason it on your own
  * Keep the end goal in mind
      * ?What is the end goal?
        * While concrete endpoints are good such as (finishing a book or getting a degree)
        * The journey is more important. ( becoming more critical, agile, consistent thinker )

Analogies to surfing
* Barrier to riding out a great wave
* Moving properly having the basics down, being consistent is important
* Sometimes the big waves are difficult and i wipeout, eat too many waves and
  * Feel exhauasted, tired, swept
* Practice on the small wave
* Don't give up keep trying. 
* Read hints about how to do ( the thinking patterns/etc in the case of math) what you want to do better
* Rest
* Focus on your dream of riding a good big wave well
  * Not how many lucky waves you caught but how you are able to consistently tackle another problem
  * Being ready if another wave or a problem comes your way
