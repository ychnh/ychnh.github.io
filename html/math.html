<li>How could I have improved in this situation?</li>

<ul>
<li>I finished determinants. Finally did.</li>
<li>How did I go about doing this?
<ul>
<li>Identified <em>big ideas</em>. </li>
<li>Made <em>plans</em> for proof. Found smaller <em>steps</em>.</li>
<li>Kept going at it. <em>Persistence</em>. <em>Returned</em> to the problem.
<ul>
<li><em>Passively</em> worked on other ideas, when stuck</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Constantly</em> had the problems looking
<ul>
<li>The folded up small pieces of paper was really good and worth it</li>
<li>What happens is a <em>reiterations</em> of feynman process
<ul>
<li>I start with some ideas on small paper. and develop some ideas until i run out of paper or want a fresh start.</li>
<li>Then I start again on a new paper but this time with the older ideas distilled/organized nicely</li>
<li><em>The last paper</em> you create should be then <em>self sufficient</em> as a organized <em>note</em> since it contains all the distilled ideas</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Concentration</li>
<li>Frequency</li>
<li>Return with a <em>fresh</em> mind</li>
<li>Using outside help. 
<ul>
<li>(As long as you understand the core idea and you are unbelievabily stuck and have exhuasted all possible options)</li>
<li>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants</li>
<li>Need to findout why you were not able to 'see' what the outside help gave you</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Immersion on new notation</li>
<li>Asking questions</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Planning out intermediate steps</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the value of coming up with an idea on your own?, Questioning at each step?</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: </li>
<li>You can <em>understand</em> the material even if the material has some error or doesn't <em>flow naturally</em>
<ul>
<li>This is <em>really</em> the way to do it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons: 
<ul>
<li>It is <em>slow</em>...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How can we get faster?</p></li>
<li>Is there an alternative simpler definition?</li>
</ul>
