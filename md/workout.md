* Really focus on the muscle contractions as you do the pulling motion. Back to the basics
# 20200819
* Deadlift
  * Gotta lean back so that the weight is on the hips as 
  * Chest out
* Pullups
  * Use wider grip
* Rear Delts and the rotator muscles I think I need to workout
  * see mantaray delt [manta ray back](https://i.imgur.com/yfTNLK1.jpg)
* Low Lats
  * I feel my low lats activate when my elbow becomes closer to my torso.
  * This is much more possible when my arms are in the underhand grip

# Fundamental idea of muscle mechanics

* Muscle can exert the most amount of force when it has been extended, ready to contract
  * Like a elastic string
* This means that for chest, you must tighten your back to allow chest muscle to extend outwards
* How about back?

* When lifting make sure to ask the question how can my body support this weight
  * Support with muscle by using opposing forces 
    * (Bicep/Triceps) 
    * (Quads/Hamstring,Hip) (Core ab and back)

* You reap what you sow
* Form, Volume, Intensity tk build Size

# Bench
* Press shoulder together
  * Lift up but to put weight on the clamped shoulder like in military press
* Lock and slide body up while keeping shoulder blades pressed down on the bench
* Feel chest not use shoulder

# Military Press
* Support Pillar Leg
* Support Pilar Spine
* Lock shoulder blades together and rest weights
* KEEP hips legs engaged as pushing weight up
* Hands wide so that elbows 90 degrees

# Deadlift
* Support Pillar Leg
* Preparation stage
  * Chest out
  * Back strong arch. Locked Position
  * Lats engaged

* 1 Lift with the lats up the knees
* 2 Lift weight hips and quads after
  * As weight moves up knees bring bar up hamstrings close to the core

## Tips
* Dont lift with back lift with (quad/hip)

# Delts
* Lock shoulder blades
* Side lateral raise

# Squat
* Use the machine to get the feeling
* Need to lean back
* Get a comfortable stance (Lock shoudler and place weight on there kinda like the other lifts)

* Foot slightly tilted, mostly straight
* Solid knees and shins support
* Squeeze abs
* Push outwards on outer edge of feet
* Chest out
* Hamstring tight, quads tight
* Don't fold knees early engage quads. Suck in knees after
* Open up hips
* Hip movement during squat

# Pullup
* High Lats
  * Begin in front lat spread
  * Stop when are makes 90 degree with forearm and bicep
* Mid Lats
  * Medium grip
  * Triceps face back at the end of the motion
* Low Lats
  * Lock shoulder outwards sides
  * Pull elbow back

* Lift with your back
* Negative lifts to get the feel


# Biceps, Triceps
* Need to do additional Research

# INDEX
* Support Pillar Leg (Quad/Hamstrings,Hip): Feet outwards 
* Support Pillar Spine (Abs/Back)
 

# Diet
* Eat chicken, potato, rice, onion, pumpkin, edamabe
* Good food
