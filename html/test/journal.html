<p>I want to faciliate Feyman method but add an option to <em>recall</em>/save and <em>continue</em> where I left off or atleast save the progerss? ShouldI even be considering about saving progress? Isn't the whole point of Feyman to <em>reduce load</em> and just the <em>on the fly</em> processing of information?
I think it is still nice to keep these notes around esp when I am building a system because i do <em>forget</em>. What is the point of <em>documenting code</em>?
I am building a <em>structure</em> so I need proofs and keep a good <em>record</em> of the reasons of my thought and distill it to nice <em>abstractions</em> 
Also how my brain works. When I get <em>stuck</em> I need to do <em>something else</em> and <em>come back</em>. I dont know why but... yea</p>

<ul>
<li>I was tired in shock and needed to recover</li>
<li>But clearly you did recover what happened?</li>
<li><p>I branched out too much in the beginning and the played catchup</p></li>
<li><p>But you were playing catch up and you still were learning</p></li>
<li>I wasn't putting in enough work = time*effort</li>
<li><p>I got to a certain point of getting enough grades to stride on by and I was satistfied</p></li>

<h1>UNIX Philosophy</h1>

<ul>
<li>let the program to do one thing and do it well (single responsibility principle)</li>
<li>make it abstract enough to be agnostic of irrelevant details or data types</li>
<li>compose separate individual programs using standard well-defined interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Becoming a more efficient programmer</h1>

<ul>
<li>Rarely couple things together</li>
<li>Make sure the code runs individually and granually</li>
<li><p>Why does it take more effort for me to code something as the project goes on</p>

<ul>
<li>increased amount of testing </li>
<li>change in complexity</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do i mitigate these things?</p></li>
<li><p>You certainly can't assume that you are not going to make changes because </p>

<ul>
<li>changes are important they are a learning experience</li>
<li>It would be ideal to limit change</li>
<li>It would also be nice  to have changes propagate</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Build modules that will be easy to construct new workflows around</p></li>

<li><p>Code moving renaming testing</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep pieces of <em>code small</em> </li>
<li>Define a <em>naming convention</em> </li>
<li>Write separate <em>testing code</em>, make it general</li>
<li>Write code in <em>small pieces</em> and <em>dont change</em> the piece so you <em>dont test</em> it again</li>
<li>Organize pieces of repeated code and <em>refactor on the spot</em> (It will save you LOTS of time in the future)
<ul>
<li>Esp when you are doing agile and testing on the fly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Not being able to continue a long process</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Make ouputs/state</em> that can continue</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>When to change philosphies</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>Adopt</em> different view</li>
<li><p>Consider the <em>values/important</em> things in the <em>context of your work</em></p></li>
<li><p>tied two processes 'normalize' and 'get_transform' </p>

<ul>
<li>process of one involves the other</li>
</ul></li>
<li>separating these two processes? make more sense from an organizational standpoint</li>
<li>UNIX prefers organization but depending on the project you work with it is different</li>
<li>I think philosophies and things change on the importance and the values of the objects that one works with.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tree Organization system which you log your questions</h1>

<pre><code>* And formulate your answers but preserve the tree 
* In an essnse youa re creating a table of contents are you write but a table of contents of questions and answers

<h1>Development Time</h1>

<ul>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Time to design</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li><p>Test/Change (Why is this after test. Should it be before?) </p>

<ul>
<li>Eh.. it dones tmatter much. Also best to find direct solution to prob prior to redesign</li>
<li>I think this is up tot detae</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make more modules and repeat the prev steps</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>When learning from examples vs theory</h1>

<ul>
<li>One begs the question why don't they just give good examples</li>
<li>since I learn well from examples it Seems
<ul>
<li>But one should know that most likely these theorms came from examples and the theorems are the distilled versions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So construct examples from the theory :) will give you the most succint examples</li>

<li>Eventually this is leading to you making your own NN framework from scratch so that you understand each step
<ul>
<li>Dont fret about having to <em>learn it all</em>.</li>
<li>This is impossible and stupid goal</li>

<li>Maybe this indicates to the limits of a GAN system?</li>
<li>Or perhaps the nature of the batch training and iteratively changing the weights</li>

<h1>When stuck</h1>

<ul>
<li>Don't just sit there. <em>Try something else</em> 
<ul>
<li>Same topic or different topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Clear what is redundant</em> or uneccesary</p>

<ul>
<li><em>organize</em> what you already have</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Start looking at other properties/ <em>terms/ideas</em> which seem important </p>

<ul>
<li>Look at the <em>basic elements</em> of your study</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And seeing how these relate or what interesting consequences resolve from these
<ul>
<li>If you didn't know it is good to know these</li>
<li>Usually these are <em>relatively simple to solve and have seen already</em> </li>
<li>Or they might lead to you to <em>more interesting questions/paths</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Interesting questions</h1>

<p>why is mirror flipped
reflection</p>

<h1>face expression pull wide (nowrinkle)</h1>

<ul>
<li>chew gum

<h1>BERT, Map Reduce, Microsoft network answers questions</h1></li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning</h1>

<p><em>Something that is worth doing is worth doing badly</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes I learn alot by doing
<ul>
<li>Coming up with specifc examples and figuring out the </li>
<li>structure as I am learning</li>
<li>Why? Because the world god built has designs in it already 
<ul>
<li>That you may be aware of or unaware of</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After doing you should take time to <em>organize</em> and </p>

<ul>
<li><em>extract</em> the important details</li>
<li>The <em>doing</em> should also be motivated for extracting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ask questions</p>

<ul>
<li>It helps to figure out</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Coding part2</h1>

<ul>
<li>The idea of modularizing your code and making each piece do well is <em>critical</em> because it gives you freedom, fresh slate, iron plate 'Helfer'</li>
<li>Having <em>test functionality</em> and <em>proof</em> of your code on paper is critical</li>
<li><p>breaking the code into components, how far is too much thought</p>

<ul>
<li>Usually if there are operations between the objects, probably a sign for a class</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sometimes breaking up to into too many pieces is not good</p></li>
<li>Make each class have a specific <em>PURPOSE</em> not just holding data
<ul>
<li>Can construct a <em>use case</em> diagram </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider the <em>states</em> that your class need to manage</li>
<li>Standardize data </li>
</ul>

<h1>Coding</h1>

<ul>
<li>Have ideas and code is physical manifestation of your ideas</li>
<li>should <em>attempt to keep the manifestation and idea 1-1</em></li>
<li>Also need to prove your ideas and also prove that the implementation is <em>equivalent</em></li>
<li>what is haskell</li>
<li>Sometimes simple concepts like interval can be represented in multiple ways
<ul>
<li>These different implementations should be able to converted from one to another
<ul>
<li>A: start point, length</li>
<li>B: Set of points which form</li>
<li>There are advantages and differences between these methods</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Sometimes I think it is worth making a map while I am developing</h1>

<h1>Also when writing</h1>

<ul>
<li>Some objects you have no idea about it might be better to writeout</li>
<li>a rough flow prior to pooling everything together since a complete organization requires</li>
<li>Aforementioned understanding </li>
</ul>

<h1>When writing a wrapper it might be better to put everything together</h1>

<ul>
<li>Than creating and granularizing the components and different chains together</li>
<li>Or it maybe worthwhile to create your own <em>granular classes</em> and <em>wrap around classes</em></li>
</ul>

<h1>Refactoring code</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>When designing, first write out all the functional components and end cases</p>

<ul>
<li>often times the grouping may depend on the <em>methods</em> not just the <em>objects</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When refactoring, </p>

<ul>
<li>Create a save point. </li>
<li>Create an end test goal.</li>
<li>Do it right. Dont take shortcuts. See <em>Unix</em> philosphy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Time Spent on getting a good grip on Fund and Homeo Graphy</h1>

<ul>
<li>Good 3 weeks</li>
<li><p>Why did it take so long.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Scrounging</em> around for right resource</li>
<li><em>Starting</em> learning something <em>prior</em> to understanding the basics</li>
<li>Trying to <em>understand too much</em> of the basics</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Solutions for the following issues</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a <em>good resource</em> before beginning (Wikipedia , Good Books) 
<ul>
<li>Note that books may have errors</li>
<li>And be written for different audiences.</li>
<li>Find the one that is right for you</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Starting learning prior to basic</em> and <em>understanding to much of basics</em> are issues that are dual</p>

<ul>
<li>since forgoing one often induces the other</li>
<li><p>A good heuristic is the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Find what you want to know the <em>end goal</em></li>
<li>Read on. If you encounter something <em>you do not understand</em> 
use the <em>good resource</em> to understand</li>
<li>Once you understand the basic something you did not understand go back 
to where you were</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Please note that this process of going back and forth <em>DOES TAKE TIME</em></p></li>
<li>But I think it is worth it considering the time lost being lost</li>
</ul></li>

<p>It begins with the discussion of the crisis in mathematics in the outbreak of the 19th century connected with the first appearance of Fourier series. Then it takes a journey through analysis keeping in mind the important historical background, taking the reader through the wonderful mathematical landscape full of dangerous, subtle pitfalls into which even the greatest mathematical minds such as Lagrange, Cauchy and even Weierstrass would fall, culminating in a return to Fourier series and Dirichlet’s proof of their convergence. </p>

<h1>MATH: Algebra and Analysis</h1>

<ul>
<li>Low dimensional support</li>
<li>Oh Gosh Real Analysis. Okay I reallly need to study both in detail</li>
<li>From my understanding there are different schools of analysis# what is this feeling of me not being sure about some concepts</li>
</ul>

<h1>Feeling overwhelmed</h1>

<p>before moving on to the bext chapter of a book.
what should i do?
go back and make a short sunmary of results like cutcosky
several phases. how do i make aure that this is not a waste of time.</p>

<h1>Synthetic Geometry</h1>

<h1>Focus</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>So there are fun projects which you are enticed to pursue. </p>

<ul>
<li>SLAM</li>
<li>HLD</li>
<li>NN/AI</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But you reallllllly should focus on improving your math skills. I am not kidding about this.</p></li>
<li>I think a good thing you should do is go through a real analysis book and algebra book one chapter one section at a time
And work through ALL the Exercises. Pick a BOOK you like</li>
</ul>

<h1>Stuck and time usage</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes you need to sitdown and spend alot of time</li>
<li>Other times a change of place and doing something else reallly helps</li>
</ul>

<h1>Stuck</h1>

<ul>
<li>Feeling stuck on the origins of cross product. Been trying to figure it out for a long time</li>
<li>How does the definition of cross product vs geometric analysis 
<ul>
<li>When thinking it is best to be clear</li>
<li>One does not know alot about the world and need the <em>help</em> of others and resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whenyou get stuck dont keept <em>staring at the same</em> thing</li>
<li>Try look for other <em>fresh</em> starting points and equivalent definitions of statements</li>
<li>Need to find a fine balance between building things from scratch and having enouhg materials to build from</li>
<li>Also clearly <em>(getting rid of the fluff)</em> of between the various approaches</li>
</ul>

<h1>math is not write first, it is like art a work of literature</h1>

<ul>
<li>its like programming write bits small that work and then</li>
<li>you will need ti refactor</li>
</ul>

<h1>Deadlift</h1>

<ul>
<li>when ti lock knees and hips</li>
<li><p>how should back look while dojng thos </p>

<h1>When doing curls</h1></li>
<li><p>elbow inwards right.</p></li>
<li>when doing pulls puah position</li>
</ul>

<h1>When developing an organized software</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes you need to rapid prototype to check that something works so that you dont end up jumping from place to places</p>

<h1>When working with a data that has  multiple forms</h1></li>
<li><p>probably a good idea to class this data </p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Speed up programing</h1>

<ul>
<li>Bridge between functional programming and object oriented</li>
<li>Build abstractions of a class and methods</li>
<li>and write a code to construct a class with collections of functions output as <em>python file</em></li>
</ul>

<h1>Organize my ideas about different representations of functions and mappings.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it just a matrix?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Is there something simliar to the coding style below? Some life philosophies that one should follow to design a certain system?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use tools in preference to unskilled help. Even if you have to detour to build the tools and throw  some of them out after you finished building them</li>
<li>Make each idea do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather tha complicate old ideas by adding new features</li>
<li>Design and build ideas, to be tried early. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them</li>
<li><p>Expect the output of each idea to become the input of another as yet unknown idea. Dont clutter output</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more time doing that worrying</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Coding Style what are some rules you can set so that the code is nice and that you dont have to go back and change stuff</h1>

<ul>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.</li>
<li>Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.</li>
<li><p>Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.</p></li>
<li><p>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</p></li>
<li>Write programs to work together.</li>
<li>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Functional vs Objective</h1>

<ul>
<li>Have a good limit. If the program isn't complicated limit the scope of organization</li>
<li>Functional: It is there. Defined. I can call it.</li>
<li>Objective: The relations between objects</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is your goal? Who are you trying to be?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I want to become a very good matehmatician 
<ul>
<li>aware of the ins and outs of various <em>approaches</em> and <em>perspectives</em></li>
<li>I cannot know all but I should know well what is I know
<ul>
<li>and is in <em>front</em> of me</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I must also get better at knowing well and taking my time to understand the <em>key points</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Feeling frustrated with SLAM?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Well, when you are learning something new esp. math</li>
<li>You gotta try hard</li>
<li>And also progress is SLOW</li>
<li>Make sure whatever progress you make is solid. Spend time on thigns that 
are the <em>essence</em> of what you are trying to do.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tree editor app?</h1>

<ul>
<li>You see yechan, the directory structure you have is very simlilar to what you want and need</li>
<li>Where you combine and group abstractions into separate folders</li>
<li>Now the quesiton you are asking is if there is a better way to seemlessly edit</li>
<li>In a fashion that is similar to VIM</li>
</ul>

<h1>I am feeling overwhelmed?</h1>

<li>SLAM\Drone</li>
<li>Landcover\Segmentation</li>
<li>HLD</li>
<li>Insillico</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I am bit wondering why it take me so long to progress in the SLAM portion</p></li>
<li>Did robotics research 1 week</li>
<li>I started reading paper 1 week</li>
<li>Some stuff in paper I do not understand well</li>
<li>Maybe I need to find a good resource and know precisely what I need to know</li>
</ul>

<h1>Frustration. Getting the right thing at the right time</h1>

<ul>
<li>Learning things</li>
<li>While I was learning different ideas and projective geometry, there were alot of basics that I needed to cover</li>
<li>Often times I would get lost because I kept having to search these different things and ideas</li>
<li>And I would get exhuasted and lose track of what I needed to do </li>
<li>I think I need to build an organizational tree of dependencies to map out what I am doing</li>
<li>While building a tree I realize that one needs to have some things organized and listed down</li>
<li>A nested list is a tree</li>
<li>Work on things slowly piece my piece. Dont move ahead without understanding the foundation
<ul>
<li>It will pay dividends in the long run.</li>

<h1>Tyson</h1>

<p>Cus Da quotes
Its what you make it. You can get distracted, there alot of things out there that can distract you.
But its up to yourself to say, well I'm not going to do that
And leave mysel fin this isolation situation for a long period of time until until its neccessary</p>

<p>Interest 'quickens' progress (Not really speed up but persistant more frequently)</p>

<p>Greatness requires passion
Absorb all sources of information
Keep your mind occupied
Study the past greats to advances learning time</p>

<p>Profit by the experienced guys. Rarely very new thigns in the world</p>

<p>Identify the requirements of the end goal
Make changes to move towards the goal
Believe that you are already great enough</p>

<h1>Kaggle Competition</h1>

<ul>
<li>After the competition is over, despite all your efforts, most likely, you will see yourself pretty low at the leaderboard. This is expected. Read carefully through the forum, read solutions that winners shared, try to understand what could you do better. Next time when you will see a similar problem, your starting point will be much higher.</li>
<li>Repeat the process on many competitions, and you will get to the top. What is more important is that you will have good pipelines for many problems at your disposal, and well-developed intuition how to deal with machine learning challenges that you face at competitions, at work, or in academia.</li>

<li>Also make all the files available on github no more local repo stuff</li>
<li>Makq the project scalable at all levels</li>
</ul>

<h1>Make sure to take breaks. They are really important</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes breaks can be just resting your eyes.</li>
<li>Sometimes break means looking at some other information or domain that you can look at
<ul>
<li>Although one needs to be bittt careful about this since its easy to overwork while doing this</li>

<h1>Don't be overwhelmed</h1>

<ul>
<li>Try to find a common pattern bewteen the various objects</li>
<li>Find simple abstractions of the more complex pattern</li>
<li>For example, there are so many different types of neural networks right? but they are just differrent constructions of doing the same thing (modeling y based on x) and have different architecture based on exploiting a specifc feature</li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Big Picture</h1>

<ul>
<li>You know actually, looking at just theorms by Cutkosky really helps me to sduy because it gives me the big picture and what parts i need instead of staring at endless large stacks of theorms</li>
<li>I think I should make such a similar document with my other classes</li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning</h1>

<ul>
<li>To start, focus on what things DO, not what they ARE.
Keywords:
big picture, learning
Text:
This course is structured with a top-down teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate. Typically, in a bottom-up approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures. The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the <em>big picture</em>, and don't know what they'll need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Harvard Professor David Perkins has a book, Making Learning Whole in which he uses baseball as an analogy. We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game. Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.</p>

<h1>tpc: Coding Design</h1>

<pre><code>* Always do things the proper way
* Choose readability and design over efficiency but try to do both
* Choose a consistent format through a workflow and stick with it
  * It may be hard to choose a good format but it will be worth it
  * It may be dependent on what can i change or what can i not change?
* When developing something, develop incrementally and test and be sure about the test
* Take breaks please. Its a waste of time to go back and redo your mistakes that you made because
  you were tired
* Alot time to learn new things and improve on what you have
* Take a visual look at the different methods available as well as the best ones
  * Survey vs Specialization (Width, Depth) 2dim
</code></pre>

<h1>tpc:</h1>

<pre><code>* principal component analysis
  * https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dfg/ProbabilisticInference/old_IDAPILecture14.pdf
* Variance - spread of data from mean
* Covariance - measure of how two random variables will 
  change when compared to each other
*
</code></pre>

<h1>thm: Central Thm of Linear Comb NN</h1>

<p>pf:
rm: 
Note that finding this idea involved going separately and actually seeing the derivatives 
being computed from layer to layer. (what is happening).
I think this is how your mind works. You need to actually go and see what is going on.</p>

<h1>thm: Any non-empty subset \(S \subset \mathbb{N}\) has a smallest element.</h1>

<p>pf: 
Take any element from our subset. Call it n. (Axiom of Choice)
Define a set L = { l | l<n }
If L is empty then n is the least element
L is finite ( Discrete Ordered Chain }
Find a smallest element inside a finite set</p>
