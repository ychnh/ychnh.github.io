<h2>Motivation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Like programming was difficult when I was young, I am beginning to understand and get better at mathematics.
It is certainly something that you can get better at!
Keep doing what you are doing. Work through the book. Organize. Review. Improve yourself.
Blind think. See what you can extend.</li>
<li>Thinking is a muscle. It is something that you can improve.</li>
