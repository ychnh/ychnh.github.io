* Attention
* LSTM tanh?

* Intrinsic Matrix
* Recovering motion is same I think Need to figure out intrinsinc
* Also re look at finding F I think it is same
* Why all cameras llok same need to investigate thie recovery of motions as well understadning

motion see if equiv if not change


* Music app to neuraly generate music that I like more deadmau5

O Repetitions in dist Ms? inspect per class information
* If there is repetition try adding noise and then evaluate model

x report
x loss going down but acc not need softmax
x Load our train2.0
x Split data into train/val
x Establish baseline
* Issue with shared batch data
  * requires grad?
  * Autograd understanding https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-101-understanding-graphs-and-automatic-differentiation/
  * Deallocate training mem while doing batch testing

* Densenet Classifier
* Add the large amounts of feature maps from generating the scope chains

Housekeep
* Dataset access chains
* SCOPE Recalc dataset missing chains (Please iterate from zero)
Questions
* In a chain setting will the connections btw homology be consistent?

x Add validation and accuracy metric
x Verify batch size w/ backward
x Find max size for resolution
x Padding to Remove crop
x Train.py w/ loss
x Create dataset class
x Clean basic model add BN/Relu
