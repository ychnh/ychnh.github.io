# 5/07
* Output result videos for B0 and spray data as well
* Issue with B2.avi due to reduced augmentation
  * Figured out issue was due to clamp upper bound set at w and h
* Design solution to yolo

* Why is the rep net not detecting nozzle even when parts of nozzle is visible?
* Why is our yolo so bad at centering the object?
  * Maybe has to with how we are augmenting a cropped image instead of aug the whole then crop
  * Solution: will we aug the image, need to get a larger outer frame when preserving the image and then crop from center
  * This is a more advanced form of cropping
  * Seems like the most recent problem is due to my pose net not being up to par to various variations in the nozzle frame capture. In otherwords, my posenet should and needs to be able to detect pose as well as the nozzle appears in the detection frame and we need to adjust the augmentation according to this
  * **We cut some corners** regarding augmentation and now we need to fix it
  * Also consider how we started training repnet from base and tranformation matrix. What is this base form.

* Design
  * We trained the pose detector with viewing the entire outer frame. If we want it to be more robust we should train pose detection with zoom and closer variation.
  * *POSE* Detection
    * Improve pose detection by training with non perfect crops and variations in crop
  * *SPRAY* detection
    * In a similar manner, sprat data should be collected to account for minor deficiencies in pose by sampling non perfect spray boxes



# 5/06
* YOLO issue solution
  * If we are continuing with B0 just add more frames to rep frames and adjust the saved B0savedata to fit the included frame size
  * Also just make  the pline points have no interval between the more frames noncontiguous frames

  * We'll take elements of our SBP and add it to predict pose during representation and pose training
  * We'll see how well it does with B0 and also how well it does with D0

  * It seems like the matrix method works better since it can model alot of other transformations other than just rotation, (includeing translation)

* How would you have a *pipeline to test different* versions of code
  * Probably best way is to do the *github branch* idea
    * Need to manage my source
    * And save *common elments in a shared location* that makes sense

* Do we even care about rotation?
  * Maybe what is important is the latent space
    * Replace y with x and set rotation to 0
    * Setting rotation to 90 to enfore high level of rotations
      * maybe 90 too extreme try 45?

# 11/6
900-920
* Email
* KTX reciept
920-1020
* Fixe loss rate of cross entropy
* Adjust ignore label
* Testing. Still having issues with roads not displaying
* The distincting between medium & large buildings not as useful due to small window size 128?
  * The paper uses 128x128 and has a smaller resolution (30cm per pixel) than our (1m per pixel) so 2 things are true
    * Their 128x128 are more high resolution allowing a distinction btw medium/large
    * Our 128x128 contains more spatial information since it is low resolution
1020-1200
* Out of memory issue
* Investigating half precision
100-408
* Debugging
* Fixed issue with roads not showing
* Experiments with multi task conclusion
  * I think small, med, large distiction doesnt work so well in our dataset
  * Also, the loss suggested in the paper is not so good since it doesn't directly penalize for over-predicting since there isn't a direct gradient adjust other than a softmax
  * Perhaps I need to traing for a longer duration
408-427
* Multi-GPU training.
  * Incrased batch size by x2
427-600
* Debugging half precision training
* Issue with NaN loss
* See like NLLLikelyhood loss's reduction has issues in f16
  * Odd since nn.mean() reduces fine in f16 but doesn't respond well the backward()
