<h2>THE ANATOMY OF CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>consciousness = intentionally ordered information</p></li>
<li><p>consciousness</p>

<ul>
<li>E := {events}, ordering: E -> O</li>
</ul></li>
<li>events</li>
<li><p>ordering</p></li>
<li><p>Intention provides ordering</p>

<ul>
<li>Act as magnetic fields, moving attention towards some objects and away from others, keeping our mind focused on some stimuli</li>

<li><p>Multiple intentions and hierachies</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Flow of Thought</h2>

<pre><code>  To enjoy a mental activity, one must meet the same conditions that makephysical  activities  enjoyable.  There  must  be  skill  in  a  symbolic  domain;there have to be rules, a goal, and a way of obtaining feedback.

  One must be able to concentrate and interact with the opportunities at alevel commensurate with one’s skills.In reality, to achieve such an ordered mental condition is not as easy asit  sounds.  Contrary  to  what  we  tend  to  assume,  the  normal  state  of  themind is chaos. Without training, and without an object in the external worldthat demands attention, people are unable to focus their thoughts for morethan a few minutes at a time. It is relatively easy to concentrate when atten-tion is structured by outside stimuli, such as when a movie is playing onthe screen, or when while driving heavy traffic is encountered on the road.If one is reading an exciting book, the same thing occurs, but most readersstill begin to lose concentration after a few pages, and their minds wanderaway from the plot. At that point, if they wish to continue reading, theymust make an effort to force their attention back to the page.We don’t usually notice how little control we have over the mind, becausehabits channel psychic energy so well that thoughts seem to follow eachother by themselves without a hitch. After sleeping we regain consciousnessin the morning when the alarm rings, and then walk to the bathroom andbrush our teeth. The social roles culture prescribes then take care of shapingour minds for us, and we generally place ourselves on automatic pilot tillthe end of the day, when it is time again to lose consciousness in sleep. Butwhen we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorderof the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow randompatterns,  usually  stopping  to  consider  something  painful  or  disturbing.Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attentionwill  be  attracted  to  whatever  is  most  problematic  at  the  moment:  it  willfocus  on  some  real  or  imaginary  pain,  on  recent  grudges  or  long-termfrustrations. Entropy is the normal state of consciousness—a condition thatis neither useful nor enjoyable.To  avoid  this  condition,  people  are  naturally  eager  to  fill  their  mindswith whatever information is readily available, as long as it distracts atten-tion from turning inward and dwelling on negative feelings. This explainswhy  such  a  huge  proportion  of  time  is  invested  in  watching  television,despite the fact that it is very rarely enjoyed. Compared to other sourcesof  stimulation—like  reading,  talking  to  other  people,  or  working  on  ahobby—TV can provide continuous and easily accessible information thatwill  structure  the  viewer’s  attention,  at  a  very  low  cost  in  terms  of  thepsychic energy that needs to be invested. While people watch television,they need not fear that their drifting minds will force them to face disturbingpersonal problems. It is understandable

  The better route for avoiding chaos in consciousness, of course, is throughhabits that give control over mental processes to the individual, rather thanto some external source of stimulation, such as the programs of networkTV. To acquire such habits requires practice, however, and the kind of goalsand rules that are inherent in flow activities. For instance, one of the simplestways to use the mind is daydreaming: playing out some sequence of eventsas mental images.

<h2>Rules of the Games of the Mind</h2>

<p>Words</p>

<pre><code>  It  is  important  to  stress  here  a  fact  that  is  all  too  often  lost  sight  of:philosophy and science were invented and flourished because thinking is pleasurable.

  Great thinkers have always been motivated by the enjoyment of thinkingrather than by the material rewards that could be gained by it. 

  Democritus  had  a  cheerful  disposition,  and  said  that  he  “calledCheerfulness,  and  often  Confidence,  that  is  a  mind  devoid  of  fear,  thehighest good.” In other words, he enjoyed life because he had learned to control his consciousness

<h2>THE PLAY OF WORDS</h2>

<h2>Befriending Clio</h2>

<h2>THE DELIGHTS OF SCIENCE</h2>

<p>Character, the sportswriters said. They know it when they see it-its the ability to dig down and find the strength even when things are going against you</p>

<p>From the ashes of 1925, Babe Ruth rose like a rocket. Through discipline.</p>

<h2>Stretching</h2>

<pre><code>  People in a growth mindset dont just seek challenge, they thrive on it. The bigger the challenge, the more they stretch. And nowhere can it be seen more clearly than in the world of sports. You can just watch people stretch and grow.Mia Hamm, the greatest female soccer star of her time, says it straight out. All my life Ive been playing up, meaning Ive challenged myself with players older, bigger, more skillful, more experienced—in short, better than me. First she played with her older brother. Then at ten, she joined the eleven-year-old boys team. Then she threw herself into the number one college team in the United States. Each day I attempted to play up to their level . . . and I was improving faster than I ever dreamed possible. Patricia Miranda was a chubby, unathletic high school kid who wanted to wrestle. After a bad beating on the mat, she was told, Youre a joke. First she cried, then she felt: That really set my resolve . . . I had to keep going and had to know if effort and focus and belief and training could somehow legitimize me as a wrestler. Where did she get this resolve? Miranda was raised in a life devoid of challenge. But when her mother died of an aneurysm at age forty, ten-year-old Miranda came up with a principle. When youre lying on your deathbed, one of the cool things to say is, ‘I really explored myself. This sense of urgency was instilled when my mom died. If you only go through life doing stuff thats easy, shame on you. So when wrestling presented a challenge, she was ready to take it on. Her effort paid off. At twenty-four, Miranda was having the last laugh. She won the spot for her weight group on the U.S. Olympic team and came home from Athens with a bronze medal. And what was next? Yale Law School. People urged her to stay where she was already on top, but Miranda felt it was more exciting to start at the bottom again and see what she could grow into this time

<h2>Growth vs fixed mindset</h2>

<ul>
<li>two meanings to ability, not one: a fixed ability that needs to be proven, and a changeable ability that can be developed through learning. </li>
<li>That's how the mindsets were born. I knew instantly which one I had. I realized why I'd always been so concerned about mistakes and failures. And I recognized for the first time that I had a choice. When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is about proving youre smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other—the world of changing qualities—its about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself</li>
<li>IS SUCCESS ABOUT LEARNING—OR PROVING YOURE SMART?</li>
<li><p>Kids who are born smart don't do mistakes, they told us.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples</p></li>
<li><p>Academia</p>

<pre><code> One day, you go to a class that is really important to you and that you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class. You got a C+. Youre very disappointed. That evening on the way back to your home, you find that youve gotten a parking ticket. Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your experience but are sort of brushed of
 So how would they cope? I wouldnt bother to put so much time and effort into doing well in anything. (In other words, dont let anyone measure you again.) Do nothing. Stay in bed. Get drunk. Eat. Yell at someone if I get a chance to. Eat chocolate. Listen to music and pout. Go into my closet and sit there. Pick a fight with somebody. Cry. Break something. What is there to do
 What is there to do! You know, when I wrote the vignette, I intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F. It was a midterm rather than a final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were sort of brushed off, not rejected outright

<li><p>Job Career</p>

<pre><code> When I was a young woman, I wanted a prince-like mate. Very handsome, very successful. A big cheese. I wanted a glamorous career, but nothing too hard or risky. And I wanted it all to come to me as validation of who I was.   It would be many years before I was satisfied. I got a great guy, but he was a work in progress. I have a great career, but boy, is it a constant challenge. Nothing was easy. So why am I satisfied? I changed my mindse

<h2>Journaling vs Documents</h2>

<ul>
<li>Journaling should be a free flowing essence of ideas
<ul>
<li>which require reflection and going-back-to to find ideas and thoughts you have</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The documents are a carefully distilled version of the ideas which you have put into practice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frustration, stuck, burnt out</h2>

<ul>
<li>?Why does this frustration occur?
<ul>
<li>Barrier against learning it on my own, discovering it on my own</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>It is a proper way to learn</li>
<li>I have alot of pride and I think doing it this way is right</li>
</ul></li>
<li>?What is the end result?
<ul>
<li>Burnout. It's terrible.</li>
<li>Demotivation</li>
<li>I feel frustrated so I don't want to be frustrated
<ul>
<li>So I end up devaluing my pride ( which is definitely not what I want )</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>?What should be done?
<ul>
<li>Keep trying, dont give up</li>
<li>try a little bit easier version
<ul>
<li>Identify what is hard and try an easier version</li>
<li>Take some hints</li>
<li>Look at it briefly and try to reason it on your own</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep the end goal in mind
  * ?What is the end goal?
    * While concrete endpoints are good such as (finishing a book or getting a degree)
    * The journey is more important. ( becoming more critical, agile, consistent thinker )</li>

<p>Analogies to surfing</p>

<ul>
<li>Barrier to riding out a great wave</li>
<li>Moving properly having the basics down, being consistent is important</li>
<li>Sometimes the big waves are difficult and i wipeout, eat too many waves and
<ul>
<li>Feel exhauasted, tired, swept</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice on the small wave</li>
<li>Don't give up keep trying. </li>
