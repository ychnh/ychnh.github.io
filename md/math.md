* I have been working on Det for a while what skill do i need to develop to become faster better?
  * Concentration
  * Frequency
  * Return with a *fresh* mind
  * Using outside help. 
    * (As long as you understand the core idea and you are unbelievabily stuck and have exhuasted all possible options)
    * If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants
    * Need to findout why you were not able to 'see' what the outside help gave you
  * Immersion on new notation
  * Asking questions
  * Review
  * Planning out intermediate steps

* What are the value of coming up with an idea on your own?, Questioning at each step?
  * Pros: 
  * You can *understand* the material even if the material has some error or doesn't *flow naturally*
    * This is *really* the way to do it
  * Cons: 
    * It is *slow*...

* How can we get faster?
* Is there an alternative simpler definition?
