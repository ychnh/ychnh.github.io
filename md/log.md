# Kolmogrov
* "I arrived at Moscow University with a fair knowledge of mathematics. I knew in particular the beginning of set theory. I studied many questions in articles in the Encyclopedia of Brockhaus and Efron, filling out for myself what was presented too concisely in these articles."

# Math
* Learning about math is *not* about completing and proving theorem a,b,c ... and making a tabulated list. Nor is it about proving something *for the first time*. Because your *memory* is *limited* and with the *pass of time* you will forget. Stand on the shoulders of giants.
* Creations are just observations
* It is more about being able traverse/journey from a significant point to arriving at a desired point
* What can help you facilitate this process?
  * It is an adventure and exercise. Familar paths are pleasant as well as unfamiliar territory. Have no shame in repetition
  * Begin each journey at the beginning
    * Write out the process from the start each time you go to study the topic
  * Keep track of tools or common methods that will help you
    * How to solve it - book
    * Figure out how other people did it.
    * Personal journey of my logs and critical thinking styles which helped me overcome.

# Math
* What do I find difficult about doing math
  * Feeling like it is a waste of time
  * Feeling like i will not succeed
  * Feeling like I am not doing it the right way the proper way  of learning
    * Is there a right way to wrokout? But there are fundamental principals such as form and intensity
    * What are equivalent properties
      * Asking questions, Not memorizing, Organizing 

# WORK AND MY FUTURE
* Math
  * Build *tenacity* to keep going even when its hard
  * Build *memory* to work on these things in my mind
  * Constant wokring nature trying multiple proj
  * Review

* AI
  * Job that is related to interest area
  * You CAN FAIL AT DOING WHAT YOU DONT LIKE SO MIGHT AS WELL FAIL DOING WHAT YOU DO LIKE
    * GET OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

* Workout 500kg 
  * *control* the weight not just numbers going up.
  * Need to build a *strong frame* and exteriors and core

# Efficient multi-scale rl
* it is becoming clear that large combinatorics should be encoded as part of code or be simplified
* For example you can define a function which will give you all values instead of manually storing the x,y pairis

# Adsn
* Key words and terms
* Collate these terms together
  * Probably can start by looking at some key leaders

* Wht are ppl interested in?
* What will make ppl return?
  * Content
  * Service
* Aduio record

# With BIG BATCH PROCESSES
* MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN RESUME AFTER CRASH
* REMOVE STRONG DEPENDECIES SO YOU CAN RUN AGAIN A SUBSET OF PROCESS
# With AI
* Make SURE THE TRAINING DATA is ABS correct. THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS CODE VALIDATION
* Make sure to find the right balance between doing things the proper way the first time and also not overdoing things to slow you down

I want to faciliate Feyman method but add an option to *recall*/save and *continue* where I left off or atleast save the progerss? ShouldI even be considering about saving progress? Isn't the whole point of Feyman to *reduce load* and just the *on the fly* processing of information?
I think it is still nice to keep these notes around esp when I am building a system because i do *forget*. What is the point of *documenting code*?
I am building a *structure* so I need proofs and keep a good *record* of the reasons of my thought and distill it to nice *abstractions* 
Also how my brain works. When I get *stuck* I need to do *something else* and *come back*. I dont know why but... yea

# When does one write a new class. 
* I think when the objects interact with each other in some extent

# Cindris
* Most of the current literature is messy and not organized
* You need to spend alot of time to go through it
* It is not really well organized like textbooks

# What is learning
## Math in a tool like setting
* Creating tools to use later. Nice well refined tools
  * Go back and refactor your tools


* Dig around the questions you have? *Strongly encourage*
  * Go back and search more if you want

* Less is more 
* Mathematical approach to my thinking
* No computational random trying
  * Jan Segert. I would like to see the invariance used this way because

* Communicate more effectively. Speak less. Come to a common ground at end
  * Be EXTREMELY CLEAR


# Life and a state of rest
* Life will continually fall into a state of rest
* The course of easiest path
* But often times this is not what you truly desire
* You must actively design 

# Elon
* Do what you want now, not later when you are rich or retired
* Live now
* Math Core, CS side

# being stubborn
* It is good to be stubborn but not at all things
* For example lol you reached gold but was it really worth the time?
  * Do you really want to hit plat?
* Before being stubborn dont be gripped with pride
* Figure out of what you are doing is really worth it

# Focus
* Honor God. Put your life on him. Nothing else but God.
* Be who you want to be now. Live every day as if were your last.
* Chose your words wisely
* Eat properly. Take care of your health. Do the exercises that you hate
* Embrace failure

# Interesting Habits
Develop a daily writing habit
Watch popular speeches and learn how to critique them
Observe the strong communicators in your own life
Record yourself every day talking into a camera for 3 minutes
Reach out to one person a week whose work you admire
Volunteer to teach whatever you can whenever you can

# UNIX Philosophy
* let the program to do one thing and do it well (single responsibility principle)
* make it abstract enough to be agnostic of irrelevant details or data types
* compose separate individual programs using standard well-defined interfaces.

# Becoming a more efficient programmer
* Rarely couple things together
* Make sure the code runs individually and granually
* Why does it take more effort for me to code something as the project goes on
  * increased amount of testing 
  * change in complexity

* How do i mitigate these things?
* You certainly can't assume that you are not going to make changes because 
  * changes are important they are a learning experience
  * It would be ideal to limit change
  * It would also be nice  to have changes propagate

* Build modules that will be easy to construct new workflows around
* Workflows may change but modules stay the same
* How to name and organize modules?
* How to group them.
* Minimize the information pass between processes


# Approach to programming as mathematics

  * Keep pieces of *code small* 
  * Define a *naming convention* 
  * Write separate *testing code*, make it general
  * Write code in *small pieces* and *dont change* the piece so you *dont test* it again
  * Organize pieces of repeated code and *refactor on the spot* (It will save you LOTS of time in the future)
    * Esp when you are doing agile and testing on the fly

* Not being able to continue a long process
  * *Make ouputs/state* that can continue

# Medium story about recent advances in GAN
* Key thoughts. Alot of math and advanced math terms
* Really need to focus and dedicate time to math
* It is really important and will become increasingly more important
* Can't learn it all so must learn the foundations
* The basics are of upmost importances
  * Even profs have trouble at times

# Tree system generalization
* Organization through
  * Summary
  * Detail

# When to change philosphies
* _Adopt_ different view
* Consider the _values/important_ things in the _context of your work_

* tied two processes 'normalize' and 'get_transform' 
  * process of one involves the other
* separating these two processes? make more sense from an organizational standpoint
* UNIX prefers organization but depending on the project you work with it is different
* I think philosophies and things change on the importance and the values of the objects that one works with.

# Tree Organization system which you log your questions
  * And formulate your answers but preserve the tree 
  * In an essnse youa re creating a table of contents are you write but a table of contents of questions and answers

# Development Time
* Understanding
* Time to design
* Code
* Test/Change (Why is this after test. Should it be before?) 
  * Eh.. it dones tmatter much. Also best to find direct solution to prob prior to redesign
  * I think this is up tot detae

* Make more modules and repeat the prev steps


# When learning from examples vs theory
* One begs the question why don't they just give good examples
* since I learn well from examples it Seems
  * But one should know that most likely these theorms came from examples and the theorems are the distilled versions
* So construct examples from the theory :) will give you the most succint examples

# Neural Network Concepts
* Existence of Objects at multiple scales
* Reduced feature resolution 
* bootstrapping harder classes
* Vanishing Gradients
* _Batch Normalization paper_ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf
  * Or search wikipedia
  * Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift
* _Relu paper_ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08375.pdf 
* Depthwise separable convolution
* Eventually this is leading to you making your own NN framework from scratch so that you understand each step
  * Dont fret about having to _learn it all_.
  * This is impossible and stupid goal
  * Just take care to learn the concepts you currently are doing well.
  * And see if you can improve or change the _big process_

# Used gpu for deep learning
* Poomstore

# Narrow your focus
* Sometimes you might be stuck because you are trying to explore too much in depth

# Neural Network Gan
* I find it intresting that the gan can write the roads and such but can't learn to spawn in trees and buildings and such
  * Perhaps it needs more information?
  * Maybe this indicates to the limits of a GAN system?
  * Or perhaps the nature of the batch training and iteratively changing the weights

* Why is it for size specific (small/large) the size specific parameters increase performance when it doens't really change as much for medium

# Window manager
* Stick with osx
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9wm
  * Quarts windows x manager

* Or just install Ubuntu
  * What about touchpad though. "Im pretty sure they have driver for this"

    * libinput-gestures


# When stuck

* Don't just sit there. _Try something else_ 
  * Same topic or different topic
* _Clear what is redundant_ or uneccesary
  * _organize_ what you already have

* Start looking at other properties/ _terms/ideas_ which seem important 
  * Look at the _basic elements_ of your study
* And seeing how these relate or what interesting consequences resolve from these
  * If you didn't know it is good to know these
  * Usually these are _relatively simple to solve and have seen already_ 
  * Or they might lead to you to _more interesting questions/paths_


# Interesting questions
why is mirror flipped
reflection

# face expression pull wide (nowrinkle)
* chew gum
*
# BERT, Map Reduce, Microsoft network answers questions 

# Learning 
_Something that is worth doing is worth doing badly_

* Sometimes I learn alot by doing
  * Coming up with specifc examples and figuring out the 
  * structure as I am learning
  * Why? Because the world god built has designs in it already 
    * That you may be aware of or unaware of
* After doing you should take time to _organize_ and 
  * _extract_ the important details
  * The _doing_ should also be motivated for extracting

* Ask questions
  * It helps to figure out

# Coding part2
* The idea of modularizing your code and making each piece do well is _critical_ because it gives you freedom, fresh slate, iron plate 'Helfer'
* Having _test functionality_ and _proof_ of your code on paper is critical
* breaking the code into components, how far is too much thought
  * Usually if there are operations between the objects, probably a sign for a class

* Sometimes breaking up to into too many pieces is not good
* Make each class have a specific _PURPOSE_ not just holding data
  * Can construct a _use case_ diagram 
* Consider the _states_ that your class need to manage
* Standardize data 


# Coding
* Have ideas and code is physical manifestation of your ideas
* should _attempt to keep the manifestation and idea 1-1_
* Also need to prove your ideas and also prove that the implementation is _equivalent_
* what is haskell
* Sometimes simple concepts like interval can be represented in multiple ways
  * These different implementations should be able to converted from one to another
    * A: start point, length
    * B: Set of points which form
    * There are advantages and differences between these methods

# Sometimes I think it is worth making a map while I am developing
# Also when writing
* Some objects you have no idea about it might be better to writeout
* a rough flow prior to pooling everything together since a complete organization requires
* Aforementioned understanding 

# When writing a wrapper it might be better to put everything together
* Than creating and granularizing the components and different chains together
* Or it maybe worthwhile to create your own _granular classes_ and _wrap around classes_


# Refactoring code
* When designing, first write out all the functional components and end cases
  * often times the grouping may depend on the _methods_ not just the _objects_

* When refactoring, 
  * Create a save point. 
  * Create an end test goal.
  * Do it right. Dont take shortcuts. See _Unix_ philosphy


# Time Spent on getting a good grip on Fund and Homeo Graphy
* Good 3 weeks
* Why did it take so long.

  * _Scrounging_ around for right resource
  * _Starting_ learning something _prior_ to understanding the basics
  * Trying to _understand too much_ of the basics

* Solutions for the following issues
  * Find a _good resource_ before beginning (Wikipedia , Good Books) 
    * Note that books may have errors
    * And be written for different audiences.
    * Find the one that is right for you
  * _Starting learning prior to basic_ and _understanding to much of basics_ are issues that are dual
    * since forgoing one often induces the other
    * A good heuristic is the following
      * Find what you want to know the _end goal_
      * Read on. If you encounter something _you do not understand_ 
        use the _good resource_ to understand
      * Once you understand the basic something you did not understand go back 
        to where you were

    * Please note that this process of going back and forth _DOES TAKE TIME_
    * But I think it is worth it considering the time lost being lost


# Why must you do it?
* I thought I could not. The voice inside myself told me no
* But it is possible. It is possible to live out your dream.
* I will not bend. I may fall but I am a fighter
* Dear God, help me align to your ways. Help me listen to your calling. Help me guide my ways

It begins with the discussion of the crisis in mathematics in the outbreak of the 19th century connected with the first appearance of Fourier series. Then it takes a journey through analysis keeping in mind the important historical background, taking the reader through the wonderful mathematical landscape full of dangerous, subtle pitfalls into which even the greatest mathematical minds such as Lagrange, Cauchy and even Weierstrass would fall, culminating in a return to Fourier series and Dirichlet’s proof of their convergence. 

# MATH: Algebra and Analysis
* Low dimensional support
* Oh Gosh Real Analysis. Okay I reallly need to study both in detail
* From my understanding there are different schools of analysis# what is this feeling of me not being sure about some concepts

# Feeling overwhelmed
before moving on to the bext chapter of a book.
what should i do?
go back and make a short sunmary of results like cutcosky
several phases. how do i make aure that this is not a waste of time.


# Synthetic Geometry
* Synthetic Geometry
* Euclidean Geometry Axioms
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate

# Focus
* So there are fun projects which you are enticed to pursue. 
  * SLAM
  * HLD
  * NN/AI

* But you reallllllly should focus on improving your math skills. I am not kidding about this.
* I think a good thing you should do is go through a real analysis book and algebra book one chapter one section at a time
And work through ALL the Exercises. Pick a BOOK you like

# Stuck and time usage
* Sometimes you need to sitdown and spend alot of time
* Other times a change of place and doing something else reallly helps

# Stuck
* Feeling stuck on the origins of cross product. Been trying to figure it out for a long time
* How does the definition of cross product vs geometric analysis 
  * When thinking it is best to be clear
  * One does not know alot about the world and need the _help_ of others and resources
* Whenyou get stuck dont keept _staring at the same_ thing
* Try look for other _fresh_ starting points and equivalent definitions of statements
* Need to find a fine balance between building things from scratch and having enouhg materials to build from
* Also clearly _(getting rid of the fluff)_ of between the various approaches


# math is not write first, it is like art a work of literature
* its like programming write bits small that work and then
* you will need ti refactor

# Deadlift
* when ti lock knees and hips
* how should back look while dojng thos 
# When doing curls
* elbow inwards right.
* when doing pulls puah position

# When developing an organized software
* Sometimes you need to rapid prototype to check that something works so that you dont end up jumping from place to places
# When working with a data that has  multiple forms
* probably a good idea to class this data 

# Speed up programing
* Bridge between functional programming and object oriented
* Build abstractions of a class and methods
* and write a code to construct a class with collections of functions output as _python file_

# Organize my ideas about different representations of functions and mappings.
* Isn't it just a matrix?

# Is there something simliar to the coding style below? Some life philosophies that one should follow to design a certain system?
* Use tools in preference to unskilled help. Even if you have to detour to build the tools and throw  some of them out after you finished building them
* Make each idea do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather tha complicate old ideas by adding new features
* Design and build ideas, to be tried early. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them
* Expect the output of each idea to become the input of another as yet unknown idea. Dont clutter output

* Spend more time doing that worrying

# Coding Style what are some rules you can set so that the code is nice and that you dont have to go back and change stuff
* Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
* Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
* Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
* Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# Functional vs Objective
* Have a good limit. If the program isn't complicated limit the scope of organization
* Functional: It is there. Defined. I can call it.
* Objective: The relations between objects

# What is your goal? Who are you trying to be?
* I want to become a very good matehmatician 
  * aware of the ins and outs of various _approaches_ and _perspectives_
  * I cannot know all but I should know well what is I know
    * and is in _front_ of me
  * I must also get better at knowing well and taking my time to understand the _key points_

# Feeling frustrated with SLAM?
* Well, when you are learning something new esp. math
* You gotta try hard
* And also progress is SLOW
* Make sure whatever progress you make is solid. Spend time on thigns that 
  are the _essence_ of what you are trying to do.

# Tree editor app?
* You see yechan, the directory structure you have is very simlilar to what you want and need
* Where you combine and group abstractions into separate folders
* Now the quesiton you are asking is if there is a better way to seemlessly edit
* In a fashion that is similar to VIM

# I am feeling overwhelmed?
* Past couple of weeks my goals were
  * SLAM\Drone
  * Landcover\Segmentation
  * HLD
  * Insillico

* I am bit wondering why it take me so long to progress in the SLAM portion
* Did robotics research 1 week
* I started reading paper 1 week
* Some stuff in paper I do not understand well
* Maybe I need to find a good resource and know precisely what I need to know

# Frustration. Getting the right thing at the right time
* Learning things
* While I was learning different ideas and projective geometry, there were alot of basics that I needed to cover
* Often times I would get lost because I kept having to search these different things and ideas
* And I would get exhuasted and lose track of what I needed to do 
* I think I need to build an organizational tree of dependencies to map out what I am doing
* While building a tree I realize that one needs to have some things organized and listed down
* A nested list is a tree
* Work on things slowly piece my piece. Dont move ahead without understanding the foundation
  * It will pay dividends in the long run.

# Resnet50

# SLAM
* Statistical techniques used to approximate the above equations 
  * Kalman filters and particle filters
    * estimation of the posterior probability function 
      * for the pose of the robot 
      * and for the parameters of the map.
  * Simple bounded-region representations of uncertainty

* Set-membership techniques 
  * A method of estimating pre image of an observation for function given priors of domain
    * See example in @SE
  * Bundle adjustment
    * Bundle adjustment boils down to minimizing the reprojection error between the image locations of observed and predicted image points

  * More generally Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)

Cus Da quotes
Its what you make it. You can get distracted, there alot of things out there that can distract you.
But its up to yourself to say, well I'm not going to do that
And leave mysel fin this isolation situation for a long period of time until until its neccessary

Interest 'quickens' progress (Not really speed up but persistant more frequently)

Greatness requires passion
Absorb all sources of information
Keep your mind occupied
Study the past greats to advances learning time

Profit by the experienced guys. Rarely very new thigns in the world

Identify the requirements of the end goal
Make changes to move towards the goal
Believe that you are already great enough

# Timer app using map of city
* Train Travel Gaols Fun software design

# Car CV
* single-board computer (SBCs, e.g. Raspberry Pi)

# Kaggle Competition
* After the competition is over, despite all your efforts, most likely, you will see yourself pretty low at the leaderboard. This is expected. Read carefully through the forum, read solutions that winners shared, try to understand what could you do better. Next time when you will see a similar problem, your starting point will be much higher.
* Repeat the process on many competitions, and you will get to the top. What is more important is that you will have good pipelines for many problems at your disposal, and well-developed intuition how to deal with machine learning challenges that you face at competitions, at work, or in academia.

# SVM

# Matroid

# Bootstrap Aggregating
* Aggregating the best fit line of bootstraps from original dataset
* bootstrap: random sampling with replacement

# Gradient Boosting
* Prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees

# Random forests
* Decision Trees
	* How are they constructed?
		* Splits based on information gain Which is Entrophy(Parent) - Weighted Sum of Entrophy(Children)
		* Top Down and repeated downwards until end condition
		* Greedy Algorithm?
			* Make a locally optimal choice at each stage


# Lessons learned from developing UNet
* Make the network flexible to different types of input. Dont force a specific size
* Also make all the files available on github no more local repo stuff
* Makq the project scalable at all levels

# Make sure to take breaks. They are really important
* Sometimes breaks can be just resting your eyes.
* Sometimes break means looking at some other information or domain that you can look at
	* Although one needs to be bittt careful about this since its easy to overwork while doing this

# Manifold, Tensor train, Self Organizing Map, 
* Check wikipedia
* https://www.cid.csic.es/homes/rtaqam/web_tricap/pres/acar.pdf

# Don't be overwhelmed
* Try to find a common pattern bewteen the various objects
* Find simple abstractions of the more complex pattern
* For example, there are so many different types of neural networks right? but they are just differrent constructions of doing the same thing (modeling y based on x) and have different architecture based on exploiting a specifc feature


# Learning Big Picture

* You know actually, looking at just theorms by Cutkosky really helps me to sduy because it gives me the big picture and what parts i need instead of staring at endless large stacks of theorms
* I think I should make such a similar document with my other classes


# Goals for next 3 years
Machine learn pro with various projects and competitions
Math review and solid understanding of all book
Workout 3 500 with body build style 90kg

Have these concepts and ideas and should try doing projects instead of just learning about the ideas

##Projects:
* MOG
* HMM/Drone slam
* Personal Assistant
* Page rank algo for papers?

## Concepts
*XGBoost?
*Super-resolution
*Stylization
*GAN


# Learning
* To start, focus on what things DO, not what they ARE.
Keywords:
big picture, learning
Text:
This course is structured with a top-down teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate. Typically, in a bottom-up approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures. The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the *big picture*, and don't know what they'll need.

Harvard Professor David Perkins has a book, Making Learning Whole in which he uses baseball as an analogy. We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game. Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.


# Code structure issues
* Fix code structure issues early on
* It pays dividends in the end
	* Width/Height x/y vs row/column
* Clarity in code over efficiency (exceptions to extremely critical)
	* Function overhead, variable etc

# Emotion
* Be thankful
* Manage your expectation
* Don't be afraid to fail


# How to work without feeling tired
* Pray ask god for directions
* Dont start working without a clear plan
* Pace yourself, won the battle but lost the war
* Keep calm stay cool
* Need to absolutely take breaks
* Have a plan
* Time yourself
* keep track
* start small even taking just your phone and looking at papers
* or just changing places

# Use GAN whenever doing some project
* to criticize
* to evaluate what needs to be done

# Keep your mouth quiet
* Act only when you need to
* Control your word and action
* Meditate and externalize yourself

# 3 year plan
* I will bursh up and master the math i learned at mizzou
* i will learn more thriugh exposure at work

# Dont be anxious have a clear goal
* When you are frozen you can move
* loosen up
* step away for a bit
* do something else
	* My feet would freeeeeeze durijg soccer
	* and then i listen to music

# Bernoulli Dist
$B(x|u) = u^x(1-u)^{1-x}$

# variance and expected v
* $E(f) = \sum{p(x)f(x)}$
* $var(f)= E[ (f(x)-E[f(x)])^2 ]$
* show $var(f) = E[f(x)^2] - E[f(x)]^2$

# tpc: Not sure which is what
* There is a time where you are not sure which is which of the things you know
	* Specifically with terminology
* In this case construct a tree and approach the problem

# tpc: Learning New Concepts
* Approach the problem on your own
	* Force one to validate each mental step
	* I find it much easier to think and learn when I actually 
		see the problem and think about how to go about solving it myself

* Keep consistent data format which is appropriate
	* row column or xy (BIG HEADACHE)
* Design with debugging in mind
* Separate key parts 

# tpc: AI
* sudden changes in learning parameters due to previous memory
* Meta reinforcement learning scheme. 
	* Learning to learn

# tpc: Coding Design
	* Always do things the proper way
	* Choose readability and design over efficiency but try to do both
	* Choose a consistent format through a workflow and stick with it
		* It may be hard to choose a good format but it will be worth it
		* It may be dependent on what can i change or what can i not change?
	* When developing something, develop incrementally and test and be sure about the test
	* Take breaks please. Its a waste of time to go back and redo your mistakes that you made because
	  you were tired
	* Alot time to learn new things and improve on what you have
	* Take a visual look at the different methods available as well as the best ones
		* Survey vs Specialization (Width, Depth) 2dim
