* I finished determinants. Finally did.
* How did I go about doing this?
  * Identified *big ideas*. 
  * Made *plans* for proof. Found smaller *steps*.
  * Kept going at it. *Persistence*. *Returned* to the problem.
    * *Passively* worked on other ideas, when stuck
  * *Constantly* had the problems looking
    * The folded up small pieces of paper was really good and worth it
    * What happens is a *reiterations* of feynman process
      * I start with some ideas on small paper. and develop some ideas until i run out of paper or want a fresh start.
      * Then I start again on a new paper but this time with the older ideas distilled/organized nicely
      * *The last paper* you create should be then *self sufficient* as a organized *note* since it contains all the distilled ideas

* I have been working on Det for a while what skill do i need to develop to become faster better?
  * Concentration
  * Frequency
  * Return with a *fresh* mind
  * Using outside help. 
    * (As long as you understand the core idea and you are unbelievabily stuck and have exhuasted all possible options)
    * If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants
    * Need to findout why you were not able to 'see' what the outside help gave you
  * Immersion on new notation
  * Asking questions
  * Review
  * Planning out intermediate steps

* What are the value of coming up with an idea on your own?, Questioning at each step?
  * Pros: 
  * You can *understand* the material even if the material has some error or doesn't *flow naturally*
    * This is *really* the way to do it
  * Cons: 
    * It is *slow*...

* How can we get faster?
* Is there an alternative simpler definition?
